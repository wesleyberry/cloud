Scrum is a process framework, subset of Agile. It is used to establish processes. 
It is made up of at least a ScrumMaster, Product Owner, and team. 
The team does standups: what they did; what they are working on; any problems they might have.
Develop User story for a feature: name, description, screen and external documents, and how to test.
Reduces waste (unnecessary features).
