1) Define and explain 3 basic types of cloud services and the AWS products that are built based on them
    * Compute 
        - EC2 
        - Elastic Beanstalk
        - Lambda - function as a service
        - Auto-scaling
        - Lightsail
    * Storage 
        - S3 
        - Glacier - archiving
        - Elastic Block Storage - for EC2
        - Elastic File System - for EC2
    * Networking - controls and manage connectivity
        - VPC
        - CloudFront
        - Route53 - domain resolution

2) Difference between availability zone and region?
    * Region is a geographic area
    * availability zones reside within region and are isolated from eachother

3) What is auto-scaling?
    * automatically launch new instances
    * reduces usage during low demand
    * major reason for using AWS

4) What is geo targeting and how do you setup geo targeting on CloudFront?
    * Concept where you can show personalized content based on the audience in that area
    * Can send that content through CloudFront
        - CloudFront will detect the country

5) What are the steps involved in a CloudFormation solution?
    1) Create or use template using JSON/YAML from
    2) Save code in an S3 bucket
    3) Use AWS CloudFormation to create a stack on your template
    4) Configure stack resources

6) How do you upgrade or downgrade a system with near zero downtime?
    1) Open EC2 console
    2) Choose Operating system
    3) Launch new instance
    4) Install updates
    5) Install applications
    6) Test the instance
    7) Deploy new instance

7) What are the tools and techniques you can use in AWS to identify and correct if you are paying more than you should be?
    * Check billing table
    * Cost explorer
    * AWS Budgets
    * Cost allocation tags
    
8) Are any other alternative tools to log into the Cloud environment other than CONSOLE?
    * Putty
    * AWS CLI for Linux
    * AWS CLI for Windows

9) What services can be used to create a centralized logging solution?
    * Amazon CloudWatch Logs
    * Amazon Kinesis Firehouse
    * Amazon S3
    * Amazon Elastic Search

10) What are the native Security Logging capabilities?
    * provides history of API calls
    * security analysis
    * delivers log files to a designated S3 bucket
